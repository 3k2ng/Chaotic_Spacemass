# Chaotic_Spacemass

Chaotic Spacemass is a 2D shooting game for 2 players playing against each other.

Each player has to control 3 buttons:

- "LEFT engine button": press this button to turn left. ( turn off the left engine )
- "RIGHT engine button": press this button to turn right. ( turn off the right engine )
- "SHOOT button": press this button to shoot.

The engines need extra time to be completely turned off or turn on so you have to control both engines effectively in order to drive the spaceship.
Some tips:

- Double tap simultaneously "LEFT engine button" and "RIGHT engine button" to dash forward.

- Press both "LEFT engine button" and "RIGHT engine button" to stop the spaceship.

- Your health point will slowly increase if your "BULLET bar" is full ( 3 bullets ).
